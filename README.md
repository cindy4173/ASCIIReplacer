# ASCIIReplacer
This project is application that can let user change characters in ASCII texts

**User Responsibilities**
------------

The user must choose which ASCII texts want to play and choose which character want to replace. 


* During the first question for user, programming will ask user which texts want to play. If user's input is not a, b or c, the input is invalid. 
  And will ask to get user's input again until valid.

* To replace the character, if user type space, the programming will assign a random value to replace the ASCII texts.

* If user's choice of character is not match the other character in ASCII texts, the replace will not happen. 
  Replacing only happen when input is matched with the character in ASCII texts.
